CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) is a groundbreaking therapy for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, offering significant improvements in survival rates and response rates compared to standard therapies. Key findings from the CARTITUDE-4 study demonstrate its efficacy, with an 85% overall response rate and extended overall survival of 76% after 30 months. CARVYKTI is the first and only BCMA-targeted treatment approved by the U.S. FDA for patients who have received at least one prior line of therapy, providing a personalized approach to treating this complex disease.

**Demographics and Eligibility**

Multiple myeloma is most commonly diagnosed in adults aged 60 and older, with a median age of diagnosis around 72 years. The majority of patients (65-80%) are men. CARVYKTI's eligibility criteria include patients who have received at least one prior line of therapy for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

**CARVYKTI Treatment Benefits**

- **85% Overall Response Rate**: Demonstrated in the CARTITUDE-4 study, this high response rate indicates significant efficacy.
- **Extended Overall Survival (OS) of 76% after 30 months**: Compared to standard treatments, CARVYKTI shows improved survival rates for patients who have received prior therapies.
- **Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) of 21.8 months vs. 9.1 months for control arm**: CARVYKTI's PFS is significantly longer than standard treatments.
- **45% Reduction in Risk of Death after three-year follow-up**: This durable efficacy demonstrates the long-term benefits of CARVYKTI.

**Novel Insights and Actionable Pathways**

CARVYKTI offers a novel approach by targeting BCMA, providing a personalized treatment strategy for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Its approval marks an important milestone in the treatment landscape, offering hope for improved outcomes for those with this complex disease.
