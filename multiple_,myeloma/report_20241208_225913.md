The AURIGA study presents a significant opportunity for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are minimal residual disease (MRD) positive after induction therapy. By evaluating daratumumab plus lenalidomide versus lenalidomide alone as maintenance treatment, this phase 3 clinical trial aims to assess the conversion rate to MRD negativity following the addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide maintenance therapy.

# Overview
The AURIGA study is an ongoing phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03901963) that explores the efficacy of adding daratumumab to lenalidomide as a maintenance treatment in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are MRD positive after induction therapy. This trial seeks to determine whether the addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide improves the conversion rate to MRD negativity compared to lenalidomide alone.

# Demographic Factors
The AURIGA study has enrolled patients with various demographic characteristics:

*   Age: The trial includes patients aged 18-65 years.
*   Gender: Both male and female patients are eligible for participation.
*   ECOG Performance Status: Patients with a performance status of 0-2 (minimally symptomatic to moderately symptomatic) are included in the study.

# Eligibility Criteria
To be eligible for the AURIGA study, patients must:

*   Have been diagnosed with multiple myeloma within 60 days prior to enrollment.
*   Be MRD positive after induction therapy and have a measurable serum free light chain (SFLC) level > 10 mg/L or > 2g/dL.
*   Have completed at least one cycle of lenalidomide-based induction therapy and have achieved undetectable levels of SFLC.

# Treatment Arm
The AURIGA study consists of two treatment arms:

*   **Arm A:** Daratumumab plus lenalidomide maintenance therapy (1g of daratumumab and 25mg/day of lenalidomide, given on days 1-21, every 28 days).
*   **Arm B:** Lenalidomide alone (25mg/day, given continuously).

# Primary Objective
The primary objective of the AURIGA study is to assess the conversion rate to MRD negativity following the addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide maintenance therapy.
