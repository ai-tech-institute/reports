The IMROZ study presents significant findings for the management of multiple myeloma in transplant-ineligible patients. Key highlights include:
### **Demographic Factors**
- The patient population is broadly representative of transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
- Age distribution shows a higher percentage of patients aged 65 to 70 years (27.5%) and those aged 70 years or older (43.4%).
- Notably, there is an underrepresentation of Black patients in the trial, with only four participants among 446 enrolled.

### **Eligibility Criteria**
- The study included patients aged 18 to 80 years.
- Eligible for treatment as part of Phase 3 clinical trials.

### **Treatment Options and Outcomes**
#### Initial Therapy with Isa-VRd vs. VRd
- Isa-VRd demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression or death by 40.4% compared to VRd alone.
- This represents the first Phase 3 trial of an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody to show such a significant benefit in transplant-ineligible patients.

### **Actionable Next Steps**
1. **Consider Isa-VRd as Initial Therapy for Transplant-Ineligible Patients with Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma**: Given its superior efficacy profile compared to VRd alone, Isa-VRd stands out as an optimal choice.
2. **Address Underrepresentation of Black Patients in Trials**: Efforts must be made to increase diversity in clinical trials to ensure that treatments are representative and beneficial for all patient populations.

### **Implications and Future Directions**
The IMROZ study has significant implications for managing multiple myeloma in transplant-ineligible patients, offering a promising new treatment option. Further research will be necessary to understand long-term efficacy, side effects, and optimal dosing strategies for Isa-VRd in this population.

By incorporating these findings into clinical practice guidelines and advocating for increased diversity in clinical trials, we can work towards providing more inclusive and effective treatments for patients with multiple myeloma.
